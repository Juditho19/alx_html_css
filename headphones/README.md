# ðŸŽ§ Headphones Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page for a fictional headphone brand, built as part of the **ALX Front-End Development Program**.  
It replicates a professionally designed user interface created in Figma by UI/UX designer **Nicolas Philippot**.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate mastery of:
- Semantic HTML5
- Custom CSS styling
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility best practices

This project was built completely from scratch â€” no CSS frameworks, and no JavaScript (until the final task).
